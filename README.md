# ERC-20 Token

Small ERC-20 token project written in Solidity that I did during a Blockchain course.
This was helpfull for me to adquire the main concepts of how a ERC-20 token works.

## Disclaimer

**I'm not the author of this code**. I just followed the tutorial to learn the concepts and practice Solidity.
This project is part of the awesome course [_Curso Completo de Blockchain de cero a experto_](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-de-blockchain-de-la-a-a-la-z/) by **Joan Amengual** and **Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas**. It's in spanish :)

## Test the Smart Contract

1. There are two .sol files in this project. Download them.
2. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
3. Create a new folder and upload the two .sol files inside it.
4. Compile the ERC20.sol file. 
5. Set some initial token supply and deploy the smart contract in "Deploy & Run transactions" section.
6. Play arround with the smart contract methods using some test accounts from the list in "Deployed Contracts" section.
